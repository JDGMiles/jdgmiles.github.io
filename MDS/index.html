<p>My first response upon coming out of the talk and discussing it with a friend was that it was &ldquo;a bit pants&rdquo;. And really, frankly, and seriously, it was &ldquo;a bit pants&rdquo;. I wonder who it was aimed at. The first half (more like all but the last quarter, actually) was standard Mathematics that almost everyone in the room would have known. We&rsquo;re talking things as simple as what a prime number is, the proof that there are infinitely many, what Riemann&rsquo;s Zeta function is, etc. Even &ndash; and this is a quote from the lecture &ndash; &ldquo;do you know what a logarithm is?&rdquo;. It was the same basic material that is featured in every mainstream Maths book (from Singh to Devlin) and is assumed knowledge to even the freshest fresher.</p>

<p>What was interesting was the latter portion of the lecture, where du Sautoy discussed how the zeta function relates to the distribution of the primes and, with the help of clips from his upcoming <span class="caps">BBC</span> documentary (yes, parts of the lecture did seem like shameless plugging of his book and programmes), showed how important the zeroes are and gave the audience a more visual (read: <span class="caps">CGI</span> heavy) interpretation of the Mathematics involved. It was quite jolly and, by the time he got onto Montgomery and Dyson, I had regained interest.</p>

<p>However, I am sceptical of whether I would have been interested were I as familiar with the zeta function as I am with the basic prime-based Mathematics du Sautoy started the lecture with. The talk was a light-hearted treatment of some important Mathematics to the level of detail that a non-Mathematician could follow. But this wasn&rsquo;t a room of non-Mathematicians. It was a room of Mathematicians, some postgraduates among us, no doubt.</p>

<p>While the material that was new to me gave an interesting taster of areas I am sure to explore in detail later, I have to wonder, why? Why give this talk in this style? Why not take the opportunity to go further? To give more detail? Why not cut some of the &ldquo;jokes&rdquo; out and reduce the amount of football-talk? To ask these questions is perhaps to miss the point. Speakers such as du Sautoy may not educate but they can motivate and entertain. In an environment filled with distractions to the Mathematics student who may dispassionately see their subject as a chore, such talks are worthy.</p>

		<p><p>I thought the talk was good. Bearing in mind that there were both freshers and proffessors in the room it would have been impossible to pitch the lecture to challenge everyone while also leaving no one behind. This wasn't and couldn't have been an academic lecture on the maths of the Riemann zeta function, so instead it was a more lighthearted version. Looking around the lecture theatre you'd have had to say that most people enjoyed it, was even worth missing neighbours for.</p></p>
