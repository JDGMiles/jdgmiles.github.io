This space collects videogames I have made and contributed to.

The best way to find out about new games I am working on - or titles I have newly released - is to join my mailing list.

Emails will be short and to the point.

You can also [follow me on Twitter](GameJamJim).

Game Jam Jim is [James Miles](jdgmiles.com).
